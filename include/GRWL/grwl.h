 *   - Keys that lack a clear US mapping are named "WORLD_x"

    /*! @brief Creates a window and its associated context.
     *
     *  This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES
     *  context.  Most of the options controlling how the window and its context
     *  should be created are specified with [window hints](@ref window_hints).
     *
     *  Successful creation does not change which context is current.  Before you
     *  can use the newly created context, you need to
     *  [make it current](@ref context_current).  For information about the `share`
     *  parameter, see @ref context_sharing.
     *
     *  The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you
     *  requested, as not all parameters and hints are
     *  [hard constraints](@ref window_hints_hard).  This includes the size of the
     *  window, especially for full screen windows.  To query the actual attributes
     *  of the created window, framebuffer and context, see @ref
     *  grwlGetWindowAttrib, @ref grwlGetWindowSize and @ref grwlGetFramebufferSize.
     *
     *  To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
     *  will cover.  If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
     *  Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is
     *  recommended that you pick the primary monitor.  For more information on how
     *  to query connected monitors, see @ref monitor_monitors.
     *
     *  For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the
     *  window's _desired video mode_.  As long as a full screen window is not
     *  iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video
     *  mode is set for the specified monitor.  For more information about full
     *  screen windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_
     *  or _borderless full screen_ windows, see @ref window_windowed_full_screen.
     *
     *  Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and
     *  full screen mode with @ref grwlSetWindowMonitor.  This will not affect its
     *  OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.
     *
     *  By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the
     *  window system.  To create the window at a specific position, set the @ref
     *  GRWL_POSITION_X and @ref GRWL_POSITION_Y window hints before creation.  To
     *  restore the default behavior, set either or both hints back to
     *  `GRWL_ANY_POSITION`.
     *
     *  As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver
     *  is prohibited from starting.
     *
     *  Window systems put limits on window sizes.  Very large or very small window
     *  dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation.  Check the
     *  actual [size](@ref window_size) after creation.
     *
     *  The [swap interval](@ref buffer_swap) is not set during window creation and
     *  the initial value may vary depending on driver settings and defaults.
     *
     *  @param[in] width The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window.
     *  This must be greater than zero.
     *  @param[in] height The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window.
     *  This must be greater than zero.
     *  @param[in] title The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title.
     *  @param[in] monitor The monitor to use for full screen mode, or `nullptr` for
     *  windowed mode.
     *  @param[in] share The window whose context to share resources with, or `nullptr`
     *  to not share resources.
     *  @return The handle of the created window, or `nullptr` if an
     *  [error](@ref error_handling) occurred.
     *
     *  @errors Possible errors include @ref GRWL_NOT_INITIALIZED, @ref
     *  GRWL_INVALID_ENUM, @ref GRWL_INVALID_VALUE, @ref GRWL_API_UNAVAILABLE, @ref
     *  GRWL_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE, @ref GRWL_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE and @ref
     *  GRWL_PLATFORM_ERROR.
     *
     *  @remark @win32 Window creation will fail if the Microsoft GDI software
     *  OpenGL implementation is the only one available.
     *
     *  @remark @win32 If the executable has an icon resource named `GRWL_ICON,` it
     *  will be set as the initial icon for the window.  If no such icon is present,
     *  the `IDI_APPLICATION` icon will be used instead.  To set a different icon,
     *  see @ref grwlSetWindowIcon.
     *
     *  @remark @win32 The context to share resources with must not be current on
     *  any other thread.
     *
     *  @remark @macos The OS only supports core profile contexts for OpenGL
     *  versions 3.2 and later.  Before creating an OpenGL context of version 3.2 or
     *  later you must set the [GRWL_OPENGL_PROFILE](@ref GRWL_OPENGL_PROFILE_hint)
     *  hint accordingly.  OpenGL 3.0 and 3.1 contexts are not supported at all
     *  on macOS.
     *
     *  @remark @macos The GRWL window has no icon, as it is not a document
     *  window, but the dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon.
     *  For more information on bundles, see the
     *  [Bundle Programming
     * Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/) in the Mac
     * Developer Library.
     *
     *  @remark @macos On OS X 10.10 and later the window frame will not be rendered
     *  at full resolution on Retina displays unless the
     *  [GRWL_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER](@ref GRWL_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER_hint)
     *  hint is `true` and the `NSHighResolutionCapable` key is enabled in the
     *  application bundle's `Info.plist`.  For more information, see

     * X](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html)
     *  in the Mac Developer Library.  The GRWL test and example programs use
     *  a custom `Info.plist` template for this, which can be found as
     *  `CMake/Info.plist.in` in the source tree.
     *
     *  @remark @macos When activating frame autosaving with
     *  [GRWL_COCOA_FRAME_NAME](@ref GRWL_COCOA_FRAME_NAME_hint), the specified
     *  window size and position may be overridden by previously saved values.
     *
     *  @remark @x11 Some window managers will not respect the placement of
     *  initially hidden windows.
     *
     *  @remark @x11 Due to the asynchronous nature of X11, it may take a moment for
     *  a window to reach its requested state.  This means you may not be able to
     *  query the final size, position or other attributes directly after window
     *  creation.
     *
     *  @remark @x11 The class part of the `WM_CLASS` window property will by
     *  default be set to the window title passed to this function.  The instance
     *  part will use the contents of the `RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable, if
     *  present and not empty, or fall back to the window title.  Set the
     *  [GRWL_X11_CLASS_NAME](@ref GRWL_X11_CLASS_NAME_hint) and
     *  [GRWL_X11_INSTANCE_NAME](@ref GRWL_X11_INSTANCE_NAME_hint) window hints to
     *  override this.
     *
     *  @remark @wayland Compositors should implement the xdg-decoration protocol
     *  for GRWL to decorate the window properly.  If this protocol isn't
     *  supported, or if the compositor prefers client-side decorations, a very
     *  simple fallback frame will be drawn using the wp_viewporter protocol.  A
     *  compositor can still emit close, maximize or fullscreen events, using for
     *  instance a keybind mechanism.  If neither of these protocols is supported,
     *  the window won't be decorated.
     *
     *  @remark @wayland A full screen window will not attempt to change the mode,
     *  no matter what the requested size or refresh rate.
     *
