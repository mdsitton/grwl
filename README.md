# GRWL - Graphics Windowing Library

This is a hard fork of GLFW, compatibility is not the aim. Goal is to migrate this fork more towards a C++ style project

However the glfw history has been kept intact and many pending PR's have been merged before major refactoring work was started so those merged PR's may be useful for anyone looking to maintain a GLFW fork of their own. the glfw readme has been kept and renamed to README-GLFW.md
